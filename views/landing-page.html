          We are making some improvements to our site and would appreciate your feedback. This will help us make sure the site is easy to use for everyone.

          It should take you no longer than 10 minutes to complete.

          Please go through the website as naturally as possible. As you do this you will be asked some questions.

          <strong>Please enter your own details into the site.</strong>

          As it is a test site, it will not save any of your information, and will not be linked to your medical record.
        </p>
        <p>
          At one point in the site you may see some details shown that are not yours. That is because it is a test site, and therefore we canâ€™t show you your own details. This is fine, just continue as you normally would as if these <strong>WERE YOUR OWN DETAILS</strong>.
